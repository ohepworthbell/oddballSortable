# oddballSortable v0.1-pre-alpha
A jQuery-based, sortable list with the ability to highlight multiple children and drag-drop grouped elements. Responsive and touch-friendly! No other dependencies. Use for anything (MIT licence)

### Warning
This is a first-draft build and is very buggy and not yet fot for general purpose use.

### To do
* Improve touch-support (very buggy at the moment)
* Ability to set handles to drag with
* Ability to add active and inactive children (currently not tested, but started on the feature)
* Any other features that people might want
* Ability to drag into bin (delete items)
* Check/add ability to increase/decrease list items
* Wrap everything in an automated function

### Current known bugs
* Pretty much everything
* Poor awareness when dragging elements to the top of the list
* Generally poor performance (will need to improve structure)
* Touch support doesn't seem to fire at the moment - not sure why
* Touch long-hold for multiple-selection has broken

### Possible future additions
* Possibly look into migrating from jQuery to pure JS (no dependencies)
* Ability to move objects from one list to another
* Better integration of CSS styles (also add in SCSS support)

### Problems or suggestions
Please leave any issues, suggestions or bugs you spot in the issues and I will try and fix. Forks/pull requests/commits more than welcome :)
