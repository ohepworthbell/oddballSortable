# oddballSortable v0.1-pre-alpha
A jQuery-based, sortable list with the ability to highlight multiple children and drag-drop grouped elements. Responsive and touch-friendly!

### Warning
This is a first-draft build and is very buggy and not yet fot for general purpose use.

### To do
* Improve touch-support (very buggy at the moment)
* Ability to set handles to drag with
* Ability to add active and inactive children (currently not tested, but started on the feature)
* Any other features that people might want
